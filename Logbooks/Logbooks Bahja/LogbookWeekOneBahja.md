=> this is first week of the project where we had our introduction to the course and the project that we will be doing. we find out our team members which was team 6 after the lecture my team ans i set up a small meeting. we got our equipment for roobot from teaher we decided a day that we could go through with the requirements of the project.we had a meeting with the whole group with the entire team 6 where we were going through the requirements. We read the requirements and decided what kind of database we would use and we  divided us into sub teams, backend , frontend hardware and ux design. where i decided to be as backend member. After the meeting everyone knew which team they belonged to. We also decided to have discord as our communication channel and our meeting will be held on discord and at campus if we are all there. we all agreed that we would have a stand-up meeting on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays and sprint planning on Mondays.the working enviroment we chosed as visual code and when we read the requiremnt we needed to make some file server to sent image using google api and githhub, we decided to make an organization on github we alos chosed Nodejs and mongodb. a Since i am not familar with the database mongodb i decided to look in to it and read dokumentation on it and watch youtube toturials next week. we also desided to have kirollos as our leader on the project.
=> in total i worked this week 12 hours including lectures and taking my own notes 


 # Week 14 20 hours 

=> we had our meeting with the entire team where we all planned how things would look like and this week was to set up all technical applications and the environment. Osman, dejan and I we went through our task and we loked into the user stories and task that dejan made on github channel for us in backend.  After the meeting dejan and I worked together and set up the environment for backend and set-up backend structure, we downloaded all the dependencies express,awilix,nodemon, jsonwebtoken and connected with docker. I needed to referesh my knowldge on backend and since i didnt know anything about mongodb i took my time to watch toturials and it was hard at the begining to get a good tutorials but i did get the fundamentals but still i had more to learn. I looked how to connect on mongodb on docker and after long time trying it i did connected mongodb to core structure and added mongodb into the docker container so we can run docker with mangodb. 
=> in total i worked this week 20 hours including youtube tutorials , lectures, taking my own notes and rewatching my old web developemnt lectures to get more depth knowledge on backend since that wasnt my strongest suit.   


# week 15  20 hours

This week we started with our sprint meeting to plan what we were doing. This week we discused the user stories and after the sprint planning ended osman and I had some task together which was to work on the rest API for the get reqeust and post request for positin. since osman needed more time to learn on rest api during the week i also spent the week rewatching my old web development to referesh my mind on rest api  since i have still access on that course. But at the end of the week i could right the get function. my computer broke down and i got macbook which made it harder to redownload every set up including docker and it was really had to get it since the macbook that i was using was supporting M1 processer i asked dejan for assistance for setting up it and it took alot of hours. 
=> in total i worked this week 20 hours including lectures and my own notes.

# week 16  20 hours 
This week we started with our sprint planning since we didnt finsih our plan to complete the get and post for positions the api data was to get from database but since i havent worked how apis work on mongodb it was hard to understand how the will recieve. Web ask dejan if he could explain how the data could work so he did some mock up for the api for us to get more information to get help for the api to write and read the postion. we did exactly as the mock data showed and tried to do similar for the get request. we did it and had some issues with debugging it so it took long time to fix it. But at the end we were able to fix get request and me and osman and we started with the write function where were trying to insert all data that the robot needs for positions.
=> in total i worked this week 20 hours including lectures and my own notes.


# week 17 20 hours 
 We had our sprint planning we talked about how long we have came with our sprint goals and everyone completed their task.
 we all on the backend pair programmed together. we were working with the api calls but we coulnt still manage it but we made the get request to work. i have started with the post but still working on it. Osman and I were working with writing the API request just like the prior week, but just like the week before we were stuck and did not do much. It was getting frustrating how hard it was and no matter how many hours we out in we did not see result. It took Osman and I longer that we thought we needed to work on and finish API request but were we still stuck so Dajan came to the rescure and took over and did it for us. It was beyond frustrating to not be able to finish API request on time but it was even worse to let our team down and putting dajan in a postion where he had to take over and implemet for us while he also had his own part of the project to consentrate on during the week. 
 => in total i worked this week 20, most of the time was just stuck on problems that was not going further  

 
# week 18 13 hours 
what i did this week was go through the whole project and try to understnads things that i didnt know  such file images since dejan implemented it i wanted to learn more about it and looked some tutorials if i can be a help to help my team mate. other stuff was to changes the variable names to a propper name and making the code easy to read. and we had our meeting together with the group.

# week 19 20 hours 
This week we had our sprint planng and retrospect this weeks task was to handle robot state so that start should be iniatiated once and moving should be sent every time session is updated and stop should closed so that sewssions should no longer be editible. i fixed two different functions that fixs this issue  but i had  problem and was stuck with 3 days just trying to figure it and debugging it . me and osman  pair programmed together we did debugging on robotstate but we couldnt figure out yet. what we did was we insted used the writepostions function on session repository to write the states of the robot but we did run it to see if it was working but the "start value was not changing it is value to other values such as moving. Then another bugg needed to be fixed such as the start wasnt changing we had to fix that problem. after our meeting we sat again to fix that problem but before our retrospective meeting we end up fixing that problem and the state was working.
