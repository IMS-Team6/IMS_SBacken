# Logbook Week 17 - Sprint 3 - API requests for position - Total hours this week: ~15 hours *Easter-monday 4 days week*
*Note: Hours per week do not include lectures and other discussions...* 

  - This weeks sprint planning started with promises to finish the API Requests for position data, as the other teams were qurious what data is going to be sent and read. It was evident that documentations were needed. After a small discussion with the front-end team i got a picture of what data they need. (Meeting lasted ~60min)
  - Looking into requirements: After understanding how every team is planning on building the different parts, what data they intended to use, I went back to square one. Looking at the requirements i started "mocking" data objects, what parameters were needed and how they are meant to be used.(60min)
  - Writing documentaton: Writing documentation on each object, how it should look and how it should be used. Formatting it and submitting it to each group.(120min)
  - Promises should be kept: Checking with my team how far they have come with the API requests, turns out. Not far enough... 
  - Taking things in my own hands: Writing code for API requests, GET /sessions, GET /session/sessionID and POST session/sessionID (We defined our objects as sessions, instead of positions. A sessions might contain positions, robotState and image file). Code for error handling and uploading the project to host.(720min - 8hours)
  - Writing API documentation: Created a .md file with API request definitions and their functions... (120min) 
  - Retrospective/demo: I was happy to deliver the news that the API requests were finally done. Next Sprint goal is to write API requests for image read/write. (60min)
