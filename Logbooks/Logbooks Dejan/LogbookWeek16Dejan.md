# Logbook Week 16 - Sprint 2 - Pre study on reading/writing files - Total hours this week: ~20 hours *Easter 4 days week*

  - This week during the Sprint planning, we set new goals. Our team did not manage to finish the functions for reading and writing positions. There is a lot of uncertanty abot what data should be send and recieved. Because of that i've decided to join the hardare team during their sessions, looke at how they work and how they are planning to write the code. This gave me some idea of how the data is going to be recived and what data we will need to send to front end. (120min).
  - Sprint planing: During the sprint planing our Team didn't meed the goal, writing API requests for position data. (Spring planning: 60min)
  - Mocking data: As previously decided, Bahja and Osman were suposed to work together on the API requests for positions. Judging from the last weeks retrospective their uncertanty got me to write some mock data to help them understand how the data is suposed to be handled. (60min).
  - Presenting data: Presenting data to Bahja and Osman, explaning how to handle it and what to read and write. Doing this it was evident that it was neccessary to further explain the achitecture and how the code is to be written, what errors to handle etc. (240min)
  - Searching for file service solution: Reading and understanding the different technologies on how to read and write files, at first it was hard to find the right "thing". Google more then often directed me to online cloud services, until i finally found what i was looking for. In nodeJS there are couple of services that can be used, the two which i found most interesting were Multer and Fomidable. (190min)
  - Both techonologies were great, and mostly similar. But Formidable having a far greater community, i've decided to go for it. 
  - Playing with the code: Trying out formidable, writing code, testing requests and understanding it.(240min)
  - Setting up code structure (30min). 
  - Retrospective/Demo: Our team, didn't finish the goal for the sprint. Maybe because of the deadline for thesis work... (Meeting lasted: 60min)
