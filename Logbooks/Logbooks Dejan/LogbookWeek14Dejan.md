# Logbook Week 14 ("First week") Sprint 0 week - setting up  

  - During this week I've created a GitHub Organization as recommended by Bahja  

  - I've created a common project for the entire Team 6, the goal is that everyone has some insight of where we are in the project 

  - The project Kanban board was divided into following column EPICs, User Stories, TODO, In Progress, Ready To Test, Done 

  - In our communication channel "Discord", I've created some structure and added channel #how-we-work. This channel consist of information necessary to accomplish good workflow and eliminate confusion. I've written "how-to" series for GitHub. This is how we create Stories, Tickets, pull requests etc. 

  - Me, Osman and Bahja identified first what all our EPICs had in common. Later we focused on what EPIC should be worked on first. We split the EPIC into user stories, from them we created necessary tickets to accomplish the story.  

  - Me and Bahja did some pair programming after our backend "team" meeting. 

  - Sync meeting with the entire Team 6. During this meeting each team presented their requirements and dependencies. It was decided that the goal for  

  Sprint 0 - setting up is to makes sure that every basic functionality should work locally.  

  - Adding to the meeting, i had a small tutorial and explained the "how-to" in GitHub. Example, how to create a pull request and what to consider when committing 

  - Me and Bahja continued with pair programming and finished the basic set-up of NodeJS and Docker
