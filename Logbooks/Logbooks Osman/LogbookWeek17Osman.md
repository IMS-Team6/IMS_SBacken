# Logbook Week 17 - total hours: 20 hours

- In this weeks sprint planning we as a Backend team promised to finish the API requests for positions data. The Frontend and Mover teams will focus on the connection between the application and the mover via Bluetooth.

- Me and Bahja were again at the same place as we were in last week. Writing the API requests for positions seamed so hard and I began to regret choosing to work on backend. I truly wanted to work with REST API because I was so interested and though it would be nice to get some experience on it, but looking how things turned out I think I could have done much more if I worked instead with Frontend or Mover team. 

- Because me and Bahja could not finish the API requests on time Dejan took over and implement it for us. 

- I know that Dejan already done much more than what he was required to do and it didn't feel alright for me to just sit and watch and I know also that its too late to change my work team. Thats when I started from the beginning and began to read every commit/changes that was pushed to the Github, and tried to figure out how everything is connected in backend project.

- The sprint retrospective went alright. Every team showed and told about the updates and changes on their side.
