# Logbook Week 13 - total hours: 8 hours

- This is the start of the project, In this week we went through the requirements and decided to divide our team into three sub teams; Backend, Frontent, and Hardware/Mover teams. We also looked at the requirments given from school and decided how we will structure the whole project. We will use Discord to communications like sprint planning, stant-up meetings, and retrospectives. We selected Kirollos to lead the team and hold the communications between the team and supervisers. 

- Since our FlexiCharge project I have been interested working with backend development but I didn't have the apportunity to try it out. I decided to work in the Backend team after getting my teams approval. This is because I have no experience working with backend and I needed minimum two weeks to prepare and learn how backend development works. After deciding to work in backend team I got some tips from Dejan on what to study and how to get into backend development. 

- We had a meeting with our backend team and after undertanding the requirements we decided to use NodeJS with Express for backend development and MongoDB as a database.
