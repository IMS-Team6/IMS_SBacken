# Logbook Week 18 - total hours: 20 hours

- In this sprint our Backend team will focus mostly on requests for getting and posting images. 

-  As I mentioned in the last sprint, in order to understand properly how everything was connected and developed so far in the backend project I began to go through the commits that was done by my teammates. Finally this week after going through almost every commit I understand how everything was setup and connected. It feels so great to finally understand almost every line of code in every file of the project!

- Now after finishing reading commits and talking with my teammates I started with file validations. I implemented validations for file type and size, also error handlings.

-  The sprint ended with retrospective where everyone updated each other on their work.
