# Logbook Week 19 - total hours: 20 hours

- In this sprint our Backend team will focus mostly on Google Vision API but also continue with validations for files and sessions.

- What I did in this sprint is: 
  - Validate the uploaded image.
  - Validate the single and multi image download from database.
  - Looking for errors that might occur while downloading or uploading images. 
  - Validate robot states so that robot can start and close a session properly. (Pair programming with Bahja).

-  The sprint ended with retrospective where everyone updated each other on their work.
