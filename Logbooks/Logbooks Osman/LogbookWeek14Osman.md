# Logbook Week 14 - total hours: 14 hours

- We, at the backend team started this week by looking into EPICs and decided which one should be work on first. Then after choosing an EPIC we divided it into some user stories and user stories into small tickets. Dejan and Bahja continiued working with setting up the project with NodeJS and Docker.

- Trying to get into backend development I started learning Javascript basics and NodeJS with Express. I found tutorials on YouTube by Programming with Mosh on Javascript and Rest API development, after watching them and following the tutorials I had some understandings on how backend works. 

- What I learned:
  - Javascript fundamentals.
  - Array Methods (forEach, map, filter, etc).
  - Async Programming (promises, callback).
