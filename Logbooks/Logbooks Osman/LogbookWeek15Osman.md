# Logbook Week 15 - total hours: 23 hours

- In the sprint planning we discussed the first steps into development of the system. It was decided that teams Hardware and Frontend will start with Bluetooth connections this week. We at the Backend team will work on REST API which will follow the Three layered architecture. 

- In this sprint I tried to follow up how my teammates worked, especially by reading the code they commited to the github and the comments/documentaions Dejan wrote in between code lines. 

- I also continued to learn backend development. What I learned from tutorials on YouTube wasn't enough to work and help my teammates. I decided to contact Peter Larsson-Green (my teacher from Android development course who also gives lectures on Web development) to give me access to his previous lectures on Web development. After getting access to the lectures I learned about:
  - npm (Node Package Manager)
  - Docker basics
  - Layered Architecture in NodeJS
  - Rest API basics
  - Rest API in Express

- Ofcouse one week is not enough to learn and understand everything about the subjects I mentioned in the list, especially for me who has no experience at all working with backend projects. But I tried my best and while watching the lectures I tried to follow up and create my own basic REST API with Three Layered Architecture according to the lectures. 
- Finally after finishing my own little project it feels like I can actually work with the real project and help my teammates!
