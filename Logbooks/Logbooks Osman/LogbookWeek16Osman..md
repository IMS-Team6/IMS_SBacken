# Logbook Week 16 - total hours: 18 hours

- The week started as usual with sprint planning. Every team decided what to work on and what to deliver at the end of this sprint. We at the Backend team will work with the API requests for position data. Me and Bahja took the responsibility to work with API requests, posting and getting position data from database.

- Me and Bahja pair programmed and tried to figure out how API requests for positions should be implemented. But after trying we could not figure out how data is supposed to be handled. 

- Dejan wrote some mock data to help me and Bahja understand how data should be handled. Dejan also explained what errors should be checked and validated when handling position data.

- When Dejan showed the mock data and explained how errors should be handled. I felt like I understood it and thought it would be easy to implement it now. But again when I tried to write the API requests with Bahja we could not get it right. I thought the problem was that I didn't know how MongoDB works with REST API and thats why I went to YouTube again and watched some tutorials on using MongoDB.
