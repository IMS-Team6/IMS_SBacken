## **Way of working:** 
  - Agile: Scrumban 
  - Sprint duration: 1 week
  - Sprint planning: every Monday
  - Backlog grooming: Once a week
  - Standup: 3 times a week 
  - Retrospectives: End of sprint

## Our Culture:
Mutual respect! Everyone is responsible for delivery! Everyone does what they promise to do! 

## **Squad**
Product owner: The squad! <br>
Team lead: Kirollos <br>
Front-end: Jenny, Khaleel, Mikael, Fahed<br>
Back-end: Dejan, Bahja, Osman<br>
Hardware: Anton, Eddie, Kirollos<br>


## **GITHUB REPOSITORY Part 1:** 
  - Every repository should have a "development" branch, merge to main only when sprint is DONE! 
  - Definition of DONE: Epic -> User Story -> Issue(Ticket) -> Code Review -> Tested -> DONE! 

### How to **Epic:**
*An agile epic is a body of work that can be broken down into specific tasks (called user stories) based on the needs/requests of customers or end-users.*<br>
In this course we have already predefined Epics provided by Husqvarna AB. How do we keep track of Epics? Each "team" is responsible for their Epics, meaning managing, defining and breaking down into user stories. Each Github repository project should have a column for Epics, each epic should have a prefix  continued with the provided definition, example. 
    
    #Mower1: The Mower...

### How to **User stories:**
 *A user story is an informal, general explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of the end user. Its purpose is to articulate how a software feature will provide value to the customer.* <br>
As mentioned previously, each team is responsible of breaking down their Epics into User Stories! Each Github repository project should have a User Stories column. Each User story should have a prefix connected to the parent Epic, building on previous example.

    #Mower1.1 This is a user story...

### How to **Issues(Tickets)**: 
*What is an issues? Issue is a product of a User Story, issues are the small tasks that makes the user story  functional.* <br>
Each team is responsible of breaking down user stories to issues(tickets). Issues(Tickets) can also be created during development as bugs or missed features, therefor it is important for the creator to define the problem or the task when creating a ticket. Things to consider while creating tickets: *Is it a feature or bug? What should the issues solve? What should the code do and why?* <br>
Same as previously, issues are products of user stories and should have a prefix  example: 

    #Mower1.1.1 Bug/Feature "Boundary limits" 

## **GITHUB REPOSITORY Part 2:**

Building on previous part, the Github repository project should consist of the following columns:

| EPICs    | User Story   | TODO          | In Progress   | Ready to test  | Done          |
| -------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| #M1 Epic | #M1.1  Story | #M1.1.4 Issue | #M1.1.3 Issue | #M1.1.2 Issues | #M1.1.1 Issue |

*Each column has its purpose!* <br>
**EPICs**: should consists only of defined epic, same goes for User stories! <br>
**TODO**: should consists of the defines issues(tickets) that are not in progress <br>
**In progress:** should only consists of tickets that we are currently working on! <br>
**Ready To Test:** should consist of tickets that are solved but yet not tested! <br>
**Done:** should consist only of issues(tickets), User Stories and Epics that are done! Meaning all issues related to a story should have passed trough the Definition of DONE (See part 1)
